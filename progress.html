    <h1>Project results</h1>
    <p>Our project is called "blog". Created a database and login form. We made a page with posts. On the page there is an opportunity to go out and log in.
        The ability to add, delete, and edit posts for swarm admin. We did everything that was written in the mission.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed working as a team because everyone had their own vision and I liked to listen to ideas and offer their own. I think everyone has learned something new in our team. It was a great experience.</p>
        <p>Probably the most difficult thing was to put everything together because each did different parts and I had to not only do my part, but also quickly read the code of others in the team.
        </p>
        <p>Everything works as we intended. 
        </p>
        <p>In the future it will be much easier for me to work as a team thanks to this experience</p>
